This is a learning project.
So don't expect any eyestunning scenario or exciting game play experience.
However, any suggestion or criticism is welcomed.
The stuff I am working on and the future improvements are listed in TODO.org, which you should be able to see easily in the root directory.
Launching the game is easy as running "./ENTRY" in the root directory.
The only dependency you need is the Guix package manager, with the default gnu guix channel.
You may wonder why I don't just use the template from the author of chickadee. That is because I tried, for a whole morning, but still can't pass the autoconf and make stuff, with a stubborn error of saying GUILE([3.0]) is invalid syntax. I give up at last, sadly.
To tweak the game, see HACKING.
