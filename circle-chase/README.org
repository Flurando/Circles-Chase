* Introduction

* Note
This embeded hall-generated project is for an attempt of solving the barrier I am facing now, by following the strict modular approach and the harder way of coding
I used to use "include" and "load" alongwith "chickadee play", also I preferred procedures over scripts provided by chickdee
So I decide to implement the same stuff using a more recommended way of managing the components
Hope it works!
